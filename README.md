# Who Am I?
> Chris Germano - Software Developer, Game Designer, Independent Consultant

As a subscriber to the theory that LinkedIn exists solely for recruiters to contact other recruiters ([despite having one](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chrisgermano1/)), I think it's important to be able to lay your cards out on the table on your own terms. So I made this. I know, it looks fantastic.
